# Welcome to CowFreedom's contributing guide

Thank you so much for wanting to contribute to this project!
All of our contributors conform to the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as seen here.

This guide will help you to get your contributions accepted.

## Getting started

To get an overview of the project, it is advised to read the [Readme](README.md) file. To have the highest chance that your contributions get accepted, make sure all your contributions align to the overarching goals of the project.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

A valid and welcome contribution is creating issues. First, search if the issue you intend to report issue already exists.
If a related issue doesn't exist, use the [issue form](https://github.com/cowfreedom/gpu_dotproduct/issues/new/choose).

### Solve an issue

Wander through the [existing issues](https://github.com/cowfreedom/gpu_dotproduct/issues) to find one that interests you. If an issue has been lingering for
some time, it is most likely nobody has been working on it. Feel free to initiate a pull request containing your fix.

### Make Changes

Making changes follows the standard GitHub flow. If you have write access to the repository, feel free to create a new branch solving the issue. If your change is inconsequential such as fixing a typo or if you are the owner of the project, you can also use the main branch directly. If you don't have write access feel free to fork the repository, fix the issue and do a pull request.

### Commit your changes

Commit your chances once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template to help reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, your proposal will be reviewed. Please be patient as this may take some time.
- Somtimes you may be asked to provide changes before your request is accepted, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your Pull Request is merged!

Congratulations and thank you for the effort. CowFreedom thanks you :sparkles:.
